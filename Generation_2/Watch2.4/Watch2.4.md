# Watch 2.4

Watch 2.4 is the largest and most feature-rich device among the Generation 2 watches. It was designed to squeeze as many functions as could be packed into a single wearable, without much regard for size constraints.

## Functions

- Extensive set of outputs (see detailed schematic for the full list)

## Notes

Due to its size, 2.4 is less comfortable for daily wear but is unmatched in versatility. It is best suited for conditions requiring maximum functionality over portability.

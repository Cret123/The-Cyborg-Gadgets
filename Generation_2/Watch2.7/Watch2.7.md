# Watch 2.7

Watch 2.7 is the most powerful Generation 2 watch. It is unique in the series for being powered by a 9V battery instead of the usual 3.7V LiPo, enabling it to drive more demanding components simultaneously.

## Functions

- Dual white LEDs
- Vibrator
- Fan
- High pitch buzzer
- Low pitch buzzer

## Notes

The higher voltage allows for more intense outputs. This watch is bulkier due to the larger battery but excels in applications requiring bright lights or deafening sounds.

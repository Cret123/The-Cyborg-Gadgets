# Generation 2

Generation 2 represents a major refinement over the earliest prototypes, featuring longer lifespans, easier assembly, and a wider range of features. Unlike Generation 1, which used a circuit board, Generation 2 watches are built with wired connections. Currently they are still the largest generation.

## Devices

- [**Watch 2.0**](./Watch2.0/Watch2.0.md): The oldest and most stable functional Gen 2 watch. 
- [**Watch 2.1**](./Watch2.1/Watch2.1.md): The smallest Gen 2 watch.
- [**Watch 2.3**](./Watch2.3/Watch2.3.md): Previously the easiest to repair.
- [**Watch 2.4**](./Watch2.4/Watch2.4.md): The largest and most feature-rich Gen 2 watch.
- [**Watch 2.5**](./Watch2.5/Watch2.5.md): Using a magnetic construction, the watch can be taken apart and reconfigured, with the useful side effect of making it the hardest to destroy.
- [**Watch 2.6**](./Watch2.6/Watch2.6.md): The most compact.
- [**Watch 2.7**](./Watch2.7/Watch2.7.md): The most powerful, powered by a 9V battery.
- [**Watch 2.8**](./Watch2.8/Watch2.8.md): The lightest, featuring only light-based functions. 
- [**Watch 2.9**](./Watch2.9/Watch2.9.md): The master watch of Gen 2, most similar in features and layout to Watch 2.6.

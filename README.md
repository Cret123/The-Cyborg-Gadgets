# The Cyborg Gadgets

The Cyborg Gadgets are a project to develop non-invasive, painless body enhancements. 
It is highly beneficial to have all essential tools with you, make the impression to be very smart, and deter adversaries of low intelligence. 

These gadgets can take on any form, however tend to be built as an extension for everyday wearable objects.

## Labeling

The gadgets are all labeled, as seen in the example below:

- **Generation**: The cyborg tools are split into successive generations, depending on the type of technology being utilised:

    - The single [Generation 0](./Generation_0/Generation_0.md) gadget is a simple AA battery powered multitool using crocodile clips rather than switches to create a simple multitool gadget. 
    While only a crude prototype, it did provide the inspiration for this project and is therefore counted as the first cyborg extension.
    - [Generation 1](./Generation_1/Generation_1.md) featured a simple parallel circuit on a circuit board, introducing switches and using a LiPo battery for size. 
    - The [Second generation](./Generation_2/Generation_2.md) still retained the same circuit, however was built with wires rather than a prototype board. 
    This enhanced its lifespan from roughly 3 weeks to more than 2 years, while also making assembly easier. Currently they are the largest generation, with over a dozen registered gadgets.
    - Currently in the process of developing [Generation 3](./Generation_3/Generation_3.md), the cyborg extension relies on the Arduino platform to drastically enhance capabilities to include smart, multifunctional spy features. Surprisingly, energy consumption is reduced.
    - [Fifth generation](./Generation_5/Generation_5.md) cyborg gadgets will switch from [AVR microcontrollers]() to [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c3) based platforms, significantly improving proccessing capabilities while retaining small form factor.

- **Type of gadget**: While originally focused on watch extensions, the project now includes devices for:

    - Watches
    - Badges
    - Gloves
    - Necklaces
    - Bags

- **Induvidual number**: Within each generation and gadget type, every device is given a unique number, typically assigned in order of production.

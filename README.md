# The Watch Extension

This repository contains a series of Arduino programs designed for a customizable multitool watch extension. The watches are split into three generations. Generation 1 featured simple parrallel circuits on a soldering board. Generation 2 still retained the same circuit, however was built with wires rather than a prototype board. This enhanced its lifespan from roughly 3 weeks to more than 2 years. Now Generation 3 an arduino to transform an everyday watch a smart, multifunctional James Bond device, while suprisingly saving the amount of power used.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. (If not already) install the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the program.
4. Connect your hardware according to the pins at the top of the file.
5. Install required libraries via the Arduino Library Manager.
6. Upload the sketch to your Arduino Pro Mini.
7. Stick the arduino to your watch. Initially done by gluing magnets to the watch and arduino, to make it detachable.

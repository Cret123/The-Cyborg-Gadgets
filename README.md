# The Watch Extension

This repository contains a series of Arduino programs designed for a customizable multitool watch extension. While earlier models were made up of simple parallel circuits repeated many times, later more advanced models use a computer chip to transform an everyday watch a smart, multifunctional James Bond device. 

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. (If not already) install the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the program.
4. Connect your hardware according to the pins at the top of the file.
5. Install required libraries via the Arduino Library Manager.
6. Upload the sketch to your Arduino Pro Mini.
7. Stick the arduino to your watch. Initially done by gluing magnets to the watch and arduino, to make it detachable.

# Generation 4

Fourth generation could be considered to be a step down from its prior generation, transitioning from AT-Mega boards to AT-Tiny chips. While this generation sacrifices some flexibility in terms of available pins and memory, it drastically reduces the size, weight, and cost, resulting in lighter, more affordable, and more comfortable devices. This generation is the first generation to be split into two sub-generations: designs similar to Second generation or designs similar to the Third. Although a microchip is used, some weaker variants are more like 2nd generation watches with blink functionality. More advanced models are more like the third generation, prioritising other features onboard the chip.

## Devices

- [Watch 4.0](./Watch4.0/Watch4.0.ino) is the first gadget of the 4th generation, using an almost identical program and components to [Watch 3.0](../Generation_3/Watch3.0/Watch3.0.ino).

- [Watch 4.1](./Watch4.1/Watch4.1.ino) uses some buttons and a potentiometer to give a second generation like extension the capability to blink at different speeds.

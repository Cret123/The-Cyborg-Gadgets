# Generation 4

Forth generation watches are the first generation to use an MCU to unlock many more features. 
Most commonly used is the Arduino Pro Mini, due to its small size and low cost. However, various other arduinos are used for special cases.

- [Watch 4.0](./Watch4.0/Watch4.0.ino) was the first 4th generation watch to be built. It uses a neopixel for communication, flashing various colours and sequences for various meanings. 
- [Watch 4.1](./Watch4.1/Watch4.1.ino) made use of technology from its prior generation, utilising an SA56 display. While this improves communication, the amount of pins required to use the display limits other potential features.
- [Watch 4.2](./Watch4.2/Watch4.2.ino) shifted to a more advanced display, an SSD1306 12C OLED screen.
- [Watch 4.3](./Watch4.3/Watch4.3.ino)
- [Watch 4.4](./Watch4.4/)
- [Watch 4.5](./Watch4.5/Watch4.5.ino) is designed for expeditions, designed with many useful navigation features. The most notable amoung them is a GPS module.

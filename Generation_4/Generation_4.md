# Generation 4

Fourth generation could be considered to be a step down from its prior generation, transitioning from AT-Mega boards to AT-Tiny chips. While this generation sacrifices some flexibility in terms of available pins and memory, it drastically reduces the size, weight, and cost, resulting in lighter, more affordable, and more comfortable devices.
